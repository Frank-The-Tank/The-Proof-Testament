# The Proof Testament   

Web App made for use in formal methods and other logic courses at Pepperdine University

Frontend: Angular5

Backend: NodeJS + ExpressJS

Database: Firebase

### Download and Setup

1. Create a clone of the source repository in terminal or command line using "git clone https://github.com/Frank-The-Tank/The-Proof-Testament.git"

2. Navigate to the project folder in terminal or command line and run "npm install". If this doesn't work install yarn by running "npm install -g yarn" and then run "yarn". This is a custom package manager similar to npm.

### Starting the Server

1. To start the server simply use terminal/command line and run the command "ng serve" within the project folder.

2. To see the web app running navigate to "localhost:4200" in your browser.

3. When you are finished with your current session make sure to end the NodeJS server session using CTRL-C in terminal/command line.

### Additional Help
If you are receiving the error "Error: Could not find module '@angular-devkit/core'" run npm install @angular-devkit/core --save-dev. This is a fix until the angularCLI developers release a patch.

### Includes
This project uses a heavily modified version of the popular QuillJS library
