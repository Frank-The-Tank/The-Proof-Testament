Prove 3.12
by showing equivalence to a previous theorem

Proof:
  ¬¬p ≡ p
=    〈 (3.11) ¬p ≡ q ≡ p ≡ ¬q, with p, q ≔ ¬p, p 〉
  ¬p ≡ ¬p
=    〈 Identity of ≡ 〉
  true  ╱╱

Prove 3.13
by showing equivalence to a previous theorem

Proof:
  ¬false
=    〈 Definition of false (3.8) 〉
  ¬¬true
=    〈 Double negation 〉
  true  ╱╱

Prove 3.14
by showing equivalence to a previous theorem

Proof:
  p ≢ q
=    〈 Definition of ≢ (3.10) 〉
  ¬(p ≡ q)
=    〈 Distributivity of ¬ over ≡ (3.9) 〉
  ¬p ≡ q  ╱╱

Prove 3.19
by showing equivalence to a previous theorem

Proof:
  p ≢ q ≡ r
=    〈 Definition of ≢ (3.10) with p, q ≔ p, q ≡ r〉
  ¬(p ≡ q ≡ r)
=    〈 Definition of ≢ (3.10) with p, q ≔ p ≡ q, r 〉
  p ≡ q ≢ r  ╱╱
